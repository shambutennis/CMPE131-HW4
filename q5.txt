1. The value in variable a doesn't change after the function call
2. The value in variable b does change after the function call
3. The answers differ because for the first function call we are passing in an int which are immutable
in python, so it is not possible to chnage the value of a even though it is passed by reference. However, because lists are mutable objects
, and are passed by reference in python the value in b is incremented
